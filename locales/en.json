We started with tutoring and exam support, and over time we’ve supported more than 120 students across universities and colleges in Israel — including Hebrew University, University of Haifa, Tel Aviv University, Ben-Gurion University, the Technion, and more.",
    "about_paragraph_2": "Along the way, we created a one-of-a-kind marathon with a modern and futuristic approach to learning. Participants received interactive .pymaster files with over 80 exam-level questions, hints, and full solutions – all in a fun, structured way.",
    "about_paragraph_3": "We then expanded into entrepreneurial mentorship: turning ideas into reality through validation, research, development, launch, and marketing. We’ve helped ventures with senior profiles build end-to-end custom platforms – including UI, code, branding, and digital presence.",
